<h2> Privacy Statement </h2>

<p> Data protection is of high priority for the Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB). As a general rule, the use of
    TIBʼs services does not require the provision of any personal data. However, the processing of personal data may be
    required where a data subject wants to use special services via the TIBʼs web pages. Where the processing of personal
    data is required and where there is no legal basis for such processing, we shall obtain the data subjectʼs consent. </p>

<p> The processing of personal data, such as for example the data subjectʼs name, address, email address, or telephone
    number shall always be carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the state
    and institution-specific data protection rules and regulations applicable to the TIB. This privacy statement serves
    to inform the public about the nature, scope and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process, as well as of the rights data subjects are entitled to. </p>

<h4> Cookies </h4>
<a name="cookies" ></a>
<p> The TIB websites use cookies. Cookies are text files that are placed and stored on a computer system via an Internet
    browser and serve to render the offer of the TIB more user-friendly, effective and secure. </p>

<p> Most of the cookies used are so-called “session cookies”, which are automatically deleted at the end of the visit.
    Other cookies remain stored on the user’s terminal device until he or she deletes them. These cookies enable the TIB
    to recognise the user’s browser on his or her next visit. </p>

<p> Users can prevent and permanently object to the setting of cookies by TIB websites at any time by choosing the corresponding
    settings of the Internet browser used. Furthermore, cookies already set can be deleted at any time with the Internet
    browser or by other software programs. This is possible in all common Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates
    the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, the TIB web pages may not function properly. </p>

<h4> Use of web analysis tools </h4>
<p> For the creation of the web statistics we use the open source software Matomo (formerly PIWIK) in anonymized form.
    This means that no personal data is processed. The use of cookies in the web analysis software Matomo is deactivated. </p>

<p> When saving the user IP address, the last two octets are not processed. The collection of the user ID is deactivated.
    For the analysis, the following data is collected in addition to the access to the site and the anonymized IP address:
    Date and time of the request, page title of the requested page, URL of the previously requested page (referrer URL),
    screen resolution of the client system, local time zone, URL of clicked and downloaded files, URL of clicked external
    domains, geolocation of the client (country, region, city), main language of the used browser, user agent of the used browser. </p>

<h5> Matomo-Opt-Out </h5>

<p> The information generated with Matomo about the use of this website is processed and stored exclusively with the TIB.</p>

      ></iframe>

<p> In this case, an opt-out cookie is placed in the browser of the data subject, which prevents Matomo from storing usage
    data. When the cookies are deleted, the Matomo opt-out cookie is also deleted. Such objection (opt-out) must be redeclared when visiting the TIB website again</p>
